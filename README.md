# 🚀 Inventra

**Inventra** is a full-stack Inventory & Order Management Platform built to simplify product inventory, customer records, and sales order management through a secure and scalable architecture. The application combines a **Spring Boot** backend with a **React** frontend, providing businesses with an efficient way to manage day-to-day inventory operations using RESTful APIs and a modern web interface.

The project demonstrates enterprise backend development practices including layered architecture, JWT authentication, Spring Security, JPA/Hibernate, and relational database management.
